# mixpanel-alfred-jql

This alfred workflow walks you through some standard JQL methods. Still a work in progress. Feedback welcome.

## Requirements 

Must have Alfred with a Powerpack license: https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/
It would help if you use Mixpanel - I'm not sure what you do with these otherwise
